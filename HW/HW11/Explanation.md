This code performs a flood fill using BFS. The code works by maintaining a visited list and a queue that hold the coordinates of the pixels in the image (sr and sc are the locations). The coordinates of each pixel are stored as lists. To begin, I add the starting pixel coordinates to a queue, and then we make a while loop which will take care of the rest of the flood fill. In the while loop, we do a few things. We will first poll the first pixel coordinate in the queue and then check the values of sr and sc to see if they are out of bounds or if the color of the pixel is not the same as the color of the starting pixel. If true, then the code will do nothing, and repeat the while loop with the next coordinate in the queue. If the if statements are false, meaning they are in bounds and are the same color as the original, the pixelâ€™s color is changed to the new color and the current pixel will be added to the visited list so that we do not revisit it again. Lastly, it will add the pixels on the right, left, up, and down if the coordinates are not in the visited list, allowing us to traverse/check 4-directionally as per the instructions. Note that we only check if the coordinates are in the visited list because we have the first if statement to check that they are in bounds and the right color on the next run of the while loop. Once the while loop is completed, the flood fill is then complete and we can return the image array.

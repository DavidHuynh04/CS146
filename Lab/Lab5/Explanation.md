The purpose of this code is to validate if a binary tree is actually valid binary search tree. The features to keep in mind is that the left subtree of a node, only has balues that are less than it, and the right subtree of a node only has values that are greater than it. The way my node works is to call to a helper method with the root, and two values a minimum and a maximum. These serve to keep track of the upper and lower bounds, as the left subtree of a node must have values that are less than it (therefore there exists an upper bound) and the right subtree must have values that are greater than it (therefore must have a lower bound). With this in place, we first have an if statement to check if the root is null. If it is null we can return true, as either it has fully traversed without finding any invalidations, or it is empty, and is valid. From there, we can check if the value of the current node is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, which would invalidate the binary tree so we would return false. Lastly, we can return two recursive calls, one to the left child (with an updated upper bound, because the left subtree must be less than the current node) and one to the right child (with an updated lower bound because values in the right subtree must be greater than the current node). Once all the recursive calls are done, we have validated the BST, and will return true.

The purpose of this code is to invert the binarty tree that we are given and return the root. As the base case, we will check if the root is null, if it is, we will return the root. Next, we will swap the left and the right children of the node using a temporary node. The next part is having two if statements. If the left child is not null, then we will recursively call the left child to continue travelling down the left side of the tree and swapping it's children. Once we have fully travelled down the left side, it will then move on to check if the right child is not null, and then travel down the right side swapping children. At the end of recursion, we should have travelled through the while tree, and can return the root as the tree is inverted.
